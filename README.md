TOML
====

Sublime Text 2 syntax highlight for [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) format.

Installation
------------
The easiest is to install using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), but this package isn't available there yet. It is still pending approval. For now, just download "TOML.tmLanguage" and copy it to your User package folder.
